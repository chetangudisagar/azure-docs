Changes made to the Azure File share using the Azure portal, SMB, or REST, are not immediately detected and replicated like changes to the Server Endpoint are. Changes are not immediately replicated because Azure Files does not yet have change notifications/journaling, so there is no way to automatically initiate a sync session when files are changed. On Windows Server, Azure File Sync uses [Windows USN journaling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363798.aspx) to automatically initiate a sync session when files change.

To detect changes to the Azure File share, Azure File Sync has a scheduled job called a "change detection job", which enumerates every file in the file share and compares it to the sync version for that file. When the change detection job determines files have changed, Azure File Sync initiates a sync session. The change detection job is initiated every 24 hours. Because the change detection job works by enumerating every file in the Azure File share, large namespaces take longer than smaller namespaces. This means that for these namespaces, it may take longer than once every 24 hours to determine which files have changed. 

In the long run, we would like to add a change detection feature in Azure Files similar to USN on Windows Server. Help us prioritize this feature for future development by voting for it at the [Azure Files UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217298-storage/category/180670-files).
