2. In the **IoT hub** pane, enter the following information for your IoT hub:

     **Name**: Enter the name of your IoT hub. If the name you enter is valid, a green check mark appears.

     **Pricing and scale tier**: Select the **F1 - Free** tier. This option is sufficient for this demo. For more information, see the [Pricing and scale tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/).

     **Resource group**: Create a resource group to host the IoT hub or use an existing one. For more information, see [Use resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../articles/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md).

     **Location**: Select the closest location to you where the IoT hub is created.

     **Pin to dashboard**: Select this option for easy access to your IoT hub from the dashboard.

3. Click **Create**. Your IoT hub might take a few minutes to create. You can see progress in the **Notifications** pane.

5. In the **Shared access policies** pane, click the **iothubowner** policy, and then copy and make a note of the **Connection string** of your IoT hub. For more information, see [Control access to IoT Hub](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security.md).

> [!NOTE] 
You will not need this iothubowner connection string for this set-up tutorial. However, you may need it for some of the tutorials on different IoT scenarios after you complete this set-up.

## Register a device in the IoT hub for your device

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open your IoT hub.

2. Click **Device Explorer**.
3. In the Device Explorer pane, click **Add** to add a device to your IoT hub. Then do the following:

   **Device ID**: Enter the ID of the new device. Device IDs are case sensitive.

   **Authentication Type**: Select **Symmetric Key**.

   **Auto Generate Keys**: Select this check box.

   **Connect device to IoT Hub**: Click **Enable**.
