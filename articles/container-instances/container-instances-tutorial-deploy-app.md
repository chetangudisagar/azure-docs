# Deploy a container to Azure Container Instances

This is the last of a three-part tutorial. In previous sections, [a container image was created](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md) and [pushed to an Azure Container Registry](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-acr.md). This section completes the tutorial by deploying the container to Azure Container Instances. Steps completed include:

> * Deploying the container from the Azure Container Registry using the Azure CLI
> * Viewing the application in the browser
> * Viewing the container logs

## Before you begin

This tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.20 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To complete this tutorial, you need a Docker development environment. Docker provides packages that easily configure Docker on any [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) system.

Azure Cloud Shell does not include the Docker components required to complete every step this tutorial. Therefore, we recommend a local installation of the Azure CLI and Docker development environment.

## Deploy the container using the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI enables deployment of a container to Azure Container Instances in a single command. Since the container image is hosted in the private Azure Container Registry, you must include the credentials required to access it. If necessary, you can query them as shown below.

Container registry login server (update with your registry name):

```azurecli
az acr show --name <acrName> --query loginServer
```

Container registry password:

```azurecli
az acr credential show --name <acrName> --query "passwords[0].value"
```

To deploy your container image from the container registry with a resource request of 1 CPU core and 1 GB of memory, run the following command:

```azurecli
az container create --name aci-tutorial-app --image <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1 --cpu 1 --memory 1 --registry-password <acrPassword> --ip-address public -g myResourceGroup
```

Within a few seconds, you should receive an initial response from Azure Resource Manager. To view the state of the deployment, use:

```azurecli
az container show --name aci-tutorial-app --resource-group myResourceGroup --query state
```

We can continue running this command until the state changes from *pending* to *running*. Then we can proceed.

## View the application and container logs

Once the deployment succeeds, open your browser to the IP address shown in the output of the following command:

```bash
az container show --name aci-tutorial-app --resource-group myResourceGroup --query ipAddress.ip
```

```json
"13.88.176.27"
```

![Hello world app in the browser][aci-app-browser]

You can also view the log output of the container:

```azurecli
az container logs --name aci-tutorial-app -g myResourceGroup
```

Output:

```bash
listening on port 80

```
