# Deploy and use Azure Container Registry

This is part two of a three-part tutorial. In the [previous step](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md), a container image was created for a simple web application written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). In this tutorial, you push the image to an Azure Container Registry. If you have not created the container image, return to [Tutorial 1 – Create container image](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md).

The Azure Container Registry is an Azure-based, private registry, for Docker container images. This tutorial walks through deploying an Azure Container Registry instance, and pushing a container image to it. Steps completed include:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying an Azure Container Registry instance
> * Tagging container image for Azure Container Registry
> * Uploading image to Azure Container Registry

In subsequent tutorials, you deploy the container from your private registry to Azure Container Instances.

## Before you begin

This tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.20 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To complete this tutorial, you need a Docker development environment. Docker provides packages that easily configure Docker on any [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) system.

Azure Cloud Shell does not include the Docker components required to complete every step this tutorial. Therefore, we recommend a local installation of the Azure CLI and Docker development environment.

## Deploy Azure Container Registry

When deploying an Azure Container Registry, you first need a resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical collection into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroup* is created in the *eastus* region.

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create an Azure Container registry with the [az acr create](/cli/azure/acr#create) command. The name of a Container Registry **must be unique**. In the following example, we use the name *mycontainerregistry082*.

```azurecli
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainerregistry082 --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
```

Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we use `<acrname>` as a placeholder for the container registry name that you chose.

## Container registry login

You must log in to your ACR instance before pushing images to it. Use the [az acr login](/cli/azure/acr#az_acr_login) command to complete the operation. You must provide the unique name given to the container registry when it was created.

```azurecli
az acr login --name <acrName>
```

The command returns a 'Login Succeeded’ message once completed.

## Tag container image

To deploy a container image from a private registry, the image needs to be tagged with the `loginServer` name of the registry.

To see a list of current images, use the `docker images` command.

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
aci-tutorial-app             latest              5c745774dfa9        39 seconds ago       68.1 MB
```

To get the loginServer name, run the following command:

```azurecli
az acr show --name <acrName> --query loginServer --output table
```

Tag the *aci-tutorial-app* image with the loginServer of the container registry. Also, add `:v1` to the end of the image name. This tag indicates the image version number.

```bash
docker tag aci-tutorial-app <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1
```

Once tagged, run `docker images` to verify the operation.

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                                                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
aci-tutorial-app                                          latest              5c745774dfa9        39 seconds ago      68.1 MB
mycontainerregistry082.azurecr.io/aci-tutorial-app        v1                  a9dace4e1a17        7 minutes ago       68.1 MB
```

## Push image to Azure Container Registry

Push the *aci-tutorial-app* image to the registry.

Using the following example, replace the container registry loginServer name with the loginServer from your environment.

```bash
docker push <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1
```

## List images in Azure Container Registry

To return a list of images that have been pushed to your Azure Container registry, use the [az acr repository list](/cli/azure/acr/repository#list) command. Update the command with the container registry name.

```azurecli
az acr repository list --name <acrName> --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
----------------
aci-tutorial-app
```

And then to see the tags for a specific image, use the [az acr repository show-tags](/cli/azure/acr/repository#show-tags) command.

```azurecli
az acr repository show-tags --name <acrName> --repository aci-tutorial-app --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
--------
v1
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, an Azure Container Registry was prepared for use with Azure Container Instances, and the container image was pushed. The following steps were completed:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deployed an Azure Container Registry instance
> * Tagged a container image for Azure Container Registry
> * Uploaded an image to Azure Container Registry

Advance to the next tutorial to learn about deploying the container to Azure using Azure Container Instances.
