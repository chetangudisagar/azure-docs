# Why is my Azure subscription disabled and how do I reactivate it?

You might have your Azure subscription disabled because you reached your spending limit, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was canceled by the Account Administrator. See what issue applies to you and follow the steps in this article to get your subscription reactivated.

## You reached your spending limit

When your usage exhausts the monthly amounts included with your subscription, we disable your service for the remainder of that billing period. Your service is disabled to protect you from accidentally incurring charges for usage beyond the amount included with your subscription. To remove your spending limit, see [Remove the spending limit in Account Center](billing-spending-limit.md#remove).

> [!NOTE] 
> If you have a Free Trial subscription and you remove the spending limit, your subscription converts to Pay-As-You-Go at the end of the Free Trial.

To monitor and manage billing activity for Azure, see [Prevent unexpected costs with Azure billing and cost management](billing-getting-started.md) and [Set up billing alerts for your Microsoft Azure subscriptions](billing-set-up-alerts.md).

## Your bill is past due

To resolve past due balance, see [Resolve past due balance for your Azure subscription after getting an email from Azure](billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance.md).

## The bill exceeds your credit card limit

To resolve this issue, [switch to a different credit card](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md). Or if you're representing a business, you can [switch to pay by invoice](billing-how-to-pay-by-invoice.md).

## The subscription was accidentally canceled and you want to reactivate

If you're the Account Administrator and accidentally canceled a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, you can reactivate it in the Account Center.

1. Sign in to the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions).
1. Select the canceled subscription.
1. Click **Reactivate**.
