# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Shmoop For Schools

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Shmoop For Schools with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Shmoop For Schools with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Shmoop For Schools.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Shmoop For Schools (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Shmoop For Schools, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Shmoop For Schools single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Shmoop For Schools from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Shmoop For Schools from the gallery
To configure the integration of Shmoop For Schools into Azure AD, you need to add Shmoop For Schools from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Shmoop For Schools from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Shmoop For Schools**, select **Shmoop For Schools** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Shmoop For Schools is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Shmoop For Schools needs to be established.

In Shmoop For Schools, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Shmoop For Schools test user](#create-a-shmoop-for-schools-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Shmoop For Schools that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Shmoop For Schools application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Shmoop For Schools** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/active-directory-saas-shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_shmoopforschools_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Shmoop For Schools Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_shmoopforschools_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://schools.shmoop.com/public-api/saml2/start/<uniqueid>`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [Shmoop For Schools Client support team](mailto:support@shmoop.com) to get these values. 
 
4. Shmoop For Schools application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Please configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the "**User Attributes**" section on application integration page. The following screenshot shows an example for this.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_attribute.png)

	> [!NOTE]
	> Shmoop for School supports two roles for users - **Teacher** and **Student**. These roles need to be set up in Azure AD so that users can be assigned the appropriate roles. Please refer the [link](http://www.dushyantgill.com/blog/2014/12/10/roles-based-access-control-in-cloud-applications-using-azure-ad/) to understand how to configure roles in Azure AD.
	
5. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| -------------- | --------------- |
	| role           | user.assignedroles |

	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.
