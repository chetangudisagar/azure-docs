# Azure AD access reviews (Preview)

Access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage group memberships and access to enterprise applications. 

## What can you do with access reviews?
   
- You can recertify guest user access, using access reviews of their access to applications and memberships of groups, with insights that enable reviewers to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.
      
- You can recertify employees access to applications and group memberships with access reviews.
   
- You can collect the access review controls into programs relevant for your organization to track reviews for compliance or risk-sensitive applications.
