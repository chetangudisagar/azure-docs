# Redeploy Azure Stack
To redeploy Azure Stack, you must start over from scratch as described below.

## Steps to redeploy Azure Stack
1. On the development kit host, open an elevated PowerShell console > navigate to the asdk-installer.ps1 script > run it > click **Reboot**.
2. Select the base operating system (not **Azure Stack**) and click **Next**.
3. After the development kit host reboots, delete the CloudBuilder.vhdx file that was used as part of the previous deployment.
4. [Deploy the development kit](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md).
