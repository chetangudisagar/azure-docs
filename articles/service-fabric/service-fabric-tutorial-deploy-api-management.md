# Deploy API Management with Service Fabric
This tutorial is part two of a series. This tutorial shows you how to set up [Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-key-concepts.md) with Service Fabric to route traffic to a back-end service in Service Fabric.  When you're finished, you have deployed API Management to a VNET, configured an API operation to send traffic to back-end stateless services. To learn more about Azure API Management scenarios with Service Fabric, see the [overview](service-fabric-api-management-overview.md) article.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial:
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- Install the [Azure Powershell module version 4.1 or higher](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps) or [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- Create a secure [Windows cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md) or [Linux cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md) on Azure
- If you deploy a Windows cluster, set up a Windows development environment. Install [Visual Studio 2017](http://www.visualstudio.com) and the **Azure development**, **ASP.NET and web development**, and **.NET Core cross-platform development** workloads.  Then set up a [.NET development environment](service-fabric-get-started.md).
- If you deploy a Linux cluster, set up a Java development environment on [Linux](service-fabric-get-started-linux.md) or [MacOS](service-fabric-get-started-mac.md).  Install the [Service Fabric CLI](service-fabric-cli.md). 

## Sign in to Azure and select your subscription
Sign in to your Azure account select your subscription before you execute Azure commands.

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <guid>
```

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <guid>
```

## Deploy API Management
Cloud applications typically need a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. In Service Fabric, a gateway can be any stateless service such as an ASP.NET Core application, or another service designed for traffic ingress, such as Event Hubs, IoT Hub, or Azure API Management. This tutorial is an introduction to using Azure API Management as a gateway to your Service Fabric applications. API Management integrates directly with Service Fabric, allowing you to publish APIs with a rich set of routing rules to your back-end Service Fabric services. 

Now that you have a secure [Windows cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md) or [Linux cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md) on Azure, deploy API Management to the virtual network (VNET) in the subnet and NSG designated for API Management. For this tutorial, the API Management Resource Manager template is pre-configured to use the names of the VNET, subnet, and NSG that you set up in the previous [Windows cluster tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md) or [Linux cluster tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md). 

Download the following Resource Manager template and parameters file:
 
- [apim.json][apim-arm]
- [apim.parameters.json][apim-parameters-arm]

Fill in the empty parameters in the `apim.parameters.json` for your deployment.

Use the following script to deploy the Resource Manager template and parameter files for API Management:

```powershell
$ResourceGroupName = "tutorialgroup"
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -TemplateFile .\apim.json -TemplateParameterFile .\apim.parameters.json -Verbose
```

```azurecli
ResourceGroupName="tutorialgroup"
az group deployment create --name ApiMgmtDeployment --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --template-file apim.json --parameters @apim.parameters.json 
```

## Configure API Management

Once your API Management and Service Fabric cluster are deployed, you can configure security settings and a Service Fabric backend in API Management. This allows you to create a backend service policy that sends traffic to your Service Fabric cluster.

### Configure API Management Security

To configure the Service Fabric backend, you first need to configure API Management security settings. To configure security settings, go to your API Management service in the Azure portal.

#### Enable the API Management REST API

The API Management REST API is currently the only way to configure a backend service. The first step is to enable the API Management REST API and secure it.

 1. In the API Management service, select **Management API** under **Security**.
 2. Check the **Enable API Management REST API** checkbox.
 3. Note the **Management API URL**, which we use later to set up the Service Fabric backend.
 4. Generate an **Access Token** by selecting an expiry date and a key, then click the **Generate** button toward the bottom of the page.
 5. Copy the **access token** and save it.  We use the access token in the following steps. Note this is different from the primary key and secondary key.

#### Upload a Service Fabric client certificate

API Management must authenticate with your Service Fabric cluster for service discovery using a client certificate that has access to your cluster. For simplicity, this tutorial uses the same certificate specified previously when creating the [Windows cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md#createvaultandcert_anchor) or [Linux cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md#createvaultandcert_anchor), which by default can be used to access your cluster.

 1. In the API Management service, select **Client certificates** under **Security**.
 2. Click the **+ Add** button.
 2. Select the private key file (.pfx) of the cluster certificate that you specified when creating your Service Fabric cluster, give it a name, and provide the private key password.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses the same certificate for client authentication and cluster node-to-node security. You may use a separate client certificate if you have one configured to access your Service Fabric cluster.

### Configure the backend

Now that API Management security is configured, you can configure the Service Fabric backend. For Service Fabric backends, the Service Fabric cluster is the backend, rather than a specific Service Fabric service. This allows a single policy to route to more than one service in the cluster.

This step requires the access token you generated previously and the thumbprint for your cluster certificate that you previously uploaded to API Management.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used a separate client certificate in the previous step for API Management, you need the thumbprint for the client certificate in addition to the cluster certificate thumbprint in this step.

Send the following HTTP PUT request to the API Management API URL you noted earlier when enabling the API Management REST API to configure the Service Fabric backend service. You should see an `HTTP 201 Created` response when the command succeeds. 
For more information on each field, see the API Management [backend API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/apimanagementrest/azure-api-management-rest-api-contract-reference#a-namebackenda-backend).

HTTP command and URL:
```http
PUT https://your-apim.management.azure-api.net/backends/servicefabric?api-version=2016-10-10
```

Request headers:
```http
Authorization: SharedAccessSignature <your access token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Request body:
```http
{
    "description": "<description>",
    "url": "<fallback service name>",
    "protocol": "http",
    "resourceId": "<cluster HTTP management endpoint>",
    "properties": {
        "serviceFabricCluster": {
            "managementEndpoints": [ "<cluster HTTP management endpoint>" ],
            "clientCertificateThumbprint": "<client cert thumbprint>",
            "serverCertificateThumbprints": [ "<cluster cert thumbprint>" ],
            "maxPartitionResolutionRetries" : 5
        }
    }
}
```

The **url** parameter here is a fully qualified service name of a service in your cluster that all requests are routed to by default if no service name is specified in a backend policy. You may use a fake service name, such as "fabric:/fake/service" if you do not intend to have a fallback service.

Refer to the API Management [backend API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/apimanagementrest/azure-api-management-rest-api-contract-reference#a-namebackenda-backend) for more details on each field.

```python
#import requests library for making REST calls
import requests
import json

#specify url
url = 'https://your-apim.management.azure-api.net/backends/servicefabric?api-version=2016-10-10'

token = "SharedAccessSignature integration&201710140514&Lqnbei7n2Sot6doiNtxMFPUi/m9LsNa+1ZK/PdxqFl49JFWjXh1wW5Gd99r/tIOeHp6dU8UV5iZUdOPfcrm5hg=="

payload = {
    "description": "My Service Fabric backend",
    "url": "fabric:/ApiApplication/ApiWebService",
    "protocol": "http",
    "resourceId": "https://tutorialcluster.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080",
    "properties": {
        "serviceFabricCluster": {
            "managementEndpoints": [ "https://tutorialcluster.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080" ],
            "clientCertificateThumbprint": "97EDD7E4979FB072AF3E480A5E5EE34B1B89DD80",
            "serverCertificateThumbprints": [ "97EDD7E4979FB072AF3E480A5E5EE34B1B89DD80" ],
            "maxPartitionResolutionRetries" : 5
        }
    }
}

headers = {'Authorization': token, "Content-Type": "application/json"}

#Call REST API
response = requests.put(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)

#Print Response
print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)
```

## Deploy a Service Fabric back-end service

Now that you have the Service Fabric configured as a backend to API Management, you can author backend policies for your APIs that send traffic to your Service Fabric services. But first you need a service running in Service Fabric to accept requests.  If you previously created a [Windows cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md), deploy a .NET Service Fabric service.  If you previously created a [Linux cluster](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md), deploy a Java Service Fabric service.

### Deploy a .NET Service Fabric service

For this tutorial, we create a basic stateless ASP.NET Core Reliable Service using the default Web API project template. This creates an HTTP endpoint for your service, which you expose through Azure API Management:

```
/api/values
```

Start Visual Studio as Administrator and create an ASP.NET Core service:

 1. In Visual Studio, select File -> New Project.
 2. Select the Service Fabric Application template under Cloud and name it **"ApiApplication"**.
 3. Select the ASP.NET Core service template and name the project **"WebApiService"**.
 4. Select the Web API ASP.NET Core 1.1 project template.
 5. Once the project is created, open `PackageRoot\ServiceManifest.xml` and remove the `Port` attribute from the endpoint resource configuration:
 
    ```xml
    <Resources>
      <Endpoints>
        <Endpoint Protocol="http" Name="ServiceEndpoint" Type="Input" />
      </Endpoints>
    </Resources>
    ```

    This allows Service Fabric to specify a port dynamically from the application port range, which we opened through the Network Security Group in the cluster Resource Manager template, allowing traffic to flow to it from API Management.
 
 6. Press F5 in Visual Studio to verify the web API is available locally. 

    Open Service Fabric Explorer and drill down to a specific instance of the ASP.NET Core service to see the base address the service is listening on. Add `/api/values` to the base address and open it in a browser. This invokes the Get method on the ValuesController in the Web API template. It returns the default response that is provided by the template, a JSON array that contains two strings:

    ```json
    ["value1", "value2"]`
    ```

    This is the endpoint that you expose through API Management in Azure.

 7. Finally, deploy the application to your cluster in Azure. [Using Visual Studio](service-fabric-publish-app-remote-cluster.md#to-publish-an-application-using-the-publish-service-fabric-application-dialog-box), right-click the Application project and select **Publish**. Provide your cluster endpoint (for example, `mycluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000`) to deploy the application to your Service Fabric cluster in Azure.

An ASP.NET Core stateless service named `fabric:/ApiApplication/WebApiService` should now be running in your Service Fabric cluster in Azure.

### Create a Java Service Fabric service
For this tutorial, we deploy a basic web server which echoes messages back to the user. The echo server sample application contains an HTTP endpoint for your service, which you expose through Azure API Management.

1. Clone the Java getting started samples.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-java-getting-started.git
   cd service-fabric-java-getting-started
   ```

2. Edit *Services/EchoServer/EchoServer1.0/EchoServerApplication/EchoServerPkg/ServiceManifest.xml*. Update the endpoint so the service listens on port 8081.

   ```xml
   <Endpoint Name="WebEndpoint" Protocol="http" Port="8081" />
   ```

3. Save *ServiceManifest.xml*, then build the EchoServer1.0 application.

   ```bash
   cd Services/EchoServer/EchoServer1.0/
   gradle
   ```

4. Deploy the application to the cluster.

   ```bash
   cd Scripts
   sfctl cluster select --endpoint http://mycluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080
   ./install.sh
   ```

   A Java stateless service named `fabric:/EchoServerApplication/EchoServerService` should now be running in your Service Fabric cluster in Azure.

5. Open a browser and type in http://mycluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:8081/getMessage, you should see "[version 1.0]Hello World !!!" displayed.


## Create an API operation

Now we're ready to create an operation in API Management that external clients use to communicate with the ASP.NET Core stateless service running in the Service Fabric cluster.

1. Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to your API Management service deployment.
2. In the API Management service blade, select **APIs**
3. Add a new API by clicking **+API**, then **Blank API** box, and filling out the dialog box:

    - **Web service URL**: For Service Fabric backends, this URL value is not used. You can put any value here. For this tutorial, use: "http://servicefabric".
    - **Display Name**: Provide any name for your API. For this tutorial, use "Service Fabric App".
    - **Name**: Enter "service-fabric-app".
    - **URL scheme**: Select either **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, or **both**. For this tutorial, use **both**.
    - **API URL Suffix**: Provide a suffix for our API. For this tutorial, use "myapp".
 
4. Select **Service Fabric App** from the list of APIs and click **+ Add operation** to add a front-end API operation. Fill out the values:
    
    - **URL**: Select **GET** and provide a URL path for the API. For this tutorial, use "/api/values".  By default, the URL path specified here is the URL path sent to the backend Service Fabric service. If you use the same URL path here that your service uses, in this case "/api/values", then the operation works without further modification. You may also specify a URL path here that is different from the URL path used by your backend Service Fabric service, in which case you also need to specify a path rewrite in your operation policy later.
    - **Display name**: Provide any name for the API. For this tutorial, use "Values".

5. Click **Save**.

## Configure a backend policy

The backend policy ties everything together. This is where you configure the backend Service Fabric service to which requests are routed. You can apply this policy to any API operation. The [backend configuration for Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-transformation-policies#SetBackendService) provides the following request routing controls: 
 - Service instance selection by specifying a Service Fabric service instance name, either hardcoded (for example, `"fabric:/myapp/myservice"`) or generated from the HTTP request (for example, `"fabric:/myapp/users/" + context.Request.MatchedParameters["name"]`).
 - Partition resolution by generating a partition key using any Service Fabric partitioning scheme.
 - Replica selection for stateful services.
 - Resolution retry conditions that allow you to specify the conditions for re-resolving a service location and resending a request.

For this tutorial, create a backend policy that routes requests directly to the ASP.NET Core stateless service deployed earlier:

 1. Select and edit the **inbound policies** for the Values operation by clicking the edit icon, and then selecting **Code View**.
 2. In the policy code editor, add a `set-backend-service` policy under inbound policies as shown here and click the **Save** button:
    
    ```xml
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <base/>
        <set-backend-service 
           backend-id="servicefabric"
           sf-service-instance-name="fabric:/ApiApplication/WebApiService"
           sf-resolve-condition="@((int)context.Response.StatusCode != 200)" />
      </inbound>
      <backend>
        <base/>
      </backend>
      <outbound>
        <base/>
      </outbound>
    </policies>
    ```

For a full set of Service Fabric back-end policy attributes, refer to the [API Management back-end documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-transformation-policies#SetBackendService)

### Add the API to a product 

Before you can call the API, it must be added to a product where you can grant access to users. 

 1. In the API Management service, select **Products**.
 2. By default, API Management providers two products: Starter and Unlimited. Select the Unlimited product.
 3. Select **+Add APIs**.
 4. Select the `Service Fabric App` API you created in the previous steps and click the **Select** button.

### Test it

You can now try sending a request to your back-end service in Service Fabric through API Management directly from the Azure portal.

 1. In the API Management service, select **API**.
 2. In the **Service Fabric App** API you created in the previous steps, select the **Test** tab and then the **Values** operation.
 3. Click the **Send** button to send a test request to the backend service.  You should see an HTTP response similar to:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    Transfer-Encoding: chunked

    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    Vary: Origin

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://apimanagement.hosting.portal.azure.net

    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Transfer-Encoding,Date,Server,Vary,Ocp-Apim-Trace-Location

    Ocp-Apim-Trace-Location: https://apimgmtstuvyx3wa3oqhdbwy.blob.core.windows.net/apiinspectorcontainer/RaVVuJBQ9yxtdyH55BAsjQ2-1?sv=2015-07-08&sr=b&sig=Ab6dPyLpTGAU6TdmlEVu32DMfdCXTiKAASUlwSq3jcY%3D&se=2017-09-15T05%3A49%3A53Z&sp=r&traceId=ed9f1f4332e34883a774c34aa899b832

    [
    "value1",
    "value2"
    ]
    ```

## Clean up resources

A cluster is made up of other Azure resources in addition to the cluster resource itself. The simplest way to delete the cluster and all the resources it consumes is to delete the resource group.

Log in to Azure and select the subscription ID with which you want to remove the cluster.  You can find your subscription ID by logging in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). Delete the resource group and all the cluster resources using the [Remove-AzureRMResourceGroup cmdlet](/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/remove-azurermresourcegroup).

```powershell
$ResourceGroupName = "tutorialgroup"
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroupName -Force
```

```azurecli
ResourceGroupName="tutorialgroup"
az group delete --name $ResourceGroupName
```
