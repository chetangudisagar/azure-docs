# Supported browsers and devices for the Azure portal
You can run the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) on all modern desktop, tablet devices, and browsers.

### Supported devices
The Azure portal runs great on modern PCs, Macs, and tablets. If you need to manage your Azure resources from a mobile device, try the Azure app that's available for preview on iPhone and Android. For more information, see the blog post [Introducing the Azure app public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-app-preview/).

* Microsoft Edge (latest version)
* Internet Explorer 11
* Safari (latest version, Mac only)
* Chrome (latest version)
* Firefox (latest version)
