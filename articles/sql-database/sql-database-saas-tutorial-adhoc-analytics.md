# Run ad-hoc analytics queries across multiple Azure SQL databases

In this tutorial, you run distributed queries across the entire set of multi-tenant databases to enable ad-hoc analytics. Elastic Query is used to enable distributed queries, which requires an additional analytics database is deployed (to the catalog server). These queries can extract insights buried in the day-to-day operational data of the Wingtip SaaS app.


In this tutorial you learn:

> * About the global views in each database, these views enable efficient querying across tenants
> * How to deploy an ad-hoc analytics database
> * How to run distributed queries across all tenant databases



To complete this tutorial, make sure the following prerequisites are completed:

* The Wingtip SaaS app is deployed. To deploy in less than five minutes, see [Deploy and explore the Wingtip SaaS application](sql-database-saas-tutorial.md)
* Azure PowerShell is installed. For details, see [Getting started with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps)
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is installed. To download and install SSMS, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).


## Ad-hoc analytics pattern

One of the great opportunities with SaaS applications is to use the vast amount of tenant data stored centrally in the cloud. Use this data to gain insights into the operation and usage of your application. These insights can guide feature development, usability improvements, and other investments in your apps and services.

Accessing this data in a single multi-tenant database is easy, but not so easy when distributed at scale across potentially thousands of databases. One approach is to use [Elastic Query](sql-database-elastic-query-overview.md), which enables querying across a distributed set of databases with common schema. Elastic Query uses a single *head* database in which external tables are defined that mirror tables or views in the distributed (tenant) databases. Queries submitted to this head database are compiled to produce a distributed query plan, with portions of the query pushed down to the tenant databases as needed. Elastic Query uses the shard map in the catalog database to provide the location of the tenant databases. Setup and query are straightforward using standard [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/language-reference), and support ad-hoc querying from tools like Power BI and Excel.

By distributing queries across the tenant databases, Elastic Query provides immediate insight into live production data. However, as Elastic Query pulls data from potentially many databases, query latency can sometimes be higher than for equivalent queries submitted to a single multi-tenant database. Be sure to design queries to minimize the data that is returned. Elastic Query is often best suited for querying small amounts of real-time data, as opposed to building frequently used or complex analytics queries or reports. If queries don't perform well, look at the [execution plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/display-an-actual-execution-plan) to see what part of the query has been pushed down to the remote database and how much data is being returned. Queries that require complex analytical processing may be better served in some cases by extracting tenant data into a dedicated database or data warehouse optimized for analytics queries. This pattern is explained in the [tenant analytics tutorial](sql-database-saas-tutorial-tenant-analytics.md). 

## Get the Wingtip application scripts

The Wingtip SaaS scripts and application source code are available in the [WingtipSaaS](https://github.com/Microsoft/WingtipSaaS) github repo. [Steps to download the Wingtip SaaS scripts](sql-database-wtp-overview.md#download-and-unblock-the-wingtip-saas-scripts).

## Create ticket sales data

To run queries against a more interesting data set, create ticket sales data by running the ticket-generator.

1. In the *PowerShell ISE*, open the ...\\Learning Modules\\Operational Analytics\\Adhoc Analytics\\*Demo-AdhocAnalytics.ps1* script and set the following values:
   * **$DemoScenario** = 1, **Purchase tickets for events at all venues**.
2. Press **F5** to run the script and generate ticket sales. While the script is running, continue the steps in this tutorial. The ticket data is queried in the *Run ad-hoc distributed queries* section, so wait for the ticket generator to complete.

## Explore the global views

The Wingtip SaaS application is built using a tenant-per-database model, so the tenant database schema is defined from a single-tenant perspective. Tenant-specific information exists in one table, *Venue*, which always has a single row, and is implemented as a heap, without a primary key. Other tables in the schema don't need to be related to the *Venue* table, because in normal use, there is never any doubt which tenant the data belongs to.

However, when querying across all databases, it's important that Elastic Query can treat the data as if it is part of a single logical database sharded by tenant. To simulate this pattern, a set of 'global' views are added to the tenant database that project a tenant id into each of the tables that are queried globally. For example, the *VenueEvents* view adds a computed *VenueId* to the columns projected from the *Events* table. By defining the external table in the head database over *VenueEvents* (rather than the underlying *Events* table), Elastic Query is able to push down joins based on *VenueId* so they can be executed in parallel on each remote database (rather than on the head database). This dramatically reduces the amount of data that is returned, which results in a substantial increase in performance for many queries. These global views have been pre-created in all tenant databases (and in *basetenantdb*).

1. Open SSMS and [connect to the tenants1-&lt;USER&gt; server](sql-database-wtp-overview.md#explore-database-schema-and-execute-sql-queries-using-ssms).
2. Expand **Databases**, right-click **contosoconcerthall**, and select **New Query**.
3. Run the following queries to explore the difference between the single-tenant tables and the global views:

   ```T-SQL
   -- The base Venue table, that has no VenueId associated.
   SELECT * FROM Venue

   -- Notice the plural name 'Venues'. This view projects a VenueId column.
   SELECT * FROM Venues

   -- The base Events table, which has no VenueId column.
   SELECT * FROM Events

   -- This view projects the VenueId retrieved from the Venues table.
   SELECT * FROM VenueEvents
   ```

In these views, the *VenueId* is computed as a hash of the Venue name, but any approach could be used to introduce a unique value. This approach is similar to the way the tenant key is computed for use in the catalog.

To examine the definition of the *Venues* view:

1. In **Object Explorer**, expand **contosoconcethall** > **Views**:

   ![views](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/views.png)

2. Right-click **dbo.Venues**.
3. Select **Script View as** > **CREATE To** > **New Query Editor Window**

Script any of the other *Venue* views to see how they add the *VenueId*.

## Deploy the database used for ad-hoc distributed queries

This exercise deploys the *adhocanalytics* database. This is the head database that contains the schema used for querying across all tenant databases. The database is deployed to the existing catalog server, which is the server used for all management-related databases in the sample app.

1. Open ...\\Learning Modules\\Operational Analytics\\Adhoc Analytics\\*Demo-AdhocAnalytics.ps1* in the *PowerShell ISE* and set the following values:
   * **$DemoScenario** = 2, **Deploy Ad-hoc analytics database**.

2. Press **F5** to run the script and create the *adhocanalytics* database.

In the next section, you add schema to the database so it can be used to run distributed queries.

## Configure the database for running distributed queries

This exercise adds schema (the external data source and external table definitions) to the ad-hoc analytics database that enables querying across all tenant databases.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio, and connect to the Adhoc Analytics database you created in the previous step. The name of the database is *adhocanalytics*.
2. Open ...\Learning Modules\Operational Analytics\Adhoc Analytics\ *Initialize-AdhocAnalyticsDB.sql* in SSMS.
3. Review the SQL script and note the following:

   Elastic Query uses a database-scoped credential to access each of the tenant databases. This credential needs to be available in all the databases and should normally be granted the minimum rights required to enable these ad-hoc queries.

    ![create credential](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/create-credential.png)

   The external data source, that is defined to use the tenant shard map in the catalog database. By using this as the external data source, queries are distributed to all databases registered in the catalog when the query is run. Because server names are different for each deployment, this initialization script gets the location of the catalog database by retrieving the current server (@@servername) where the script is executed.

    ![create external data source](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/create-external-data-source.png)

   The external tables that reference the global views described in the previous section, and defined with **DISTRIBUTION = SHARDED(VenueId)**. Because each *VenueId* maps to a single database, this improves performance for many scenarios as shown in the next section.

    ![create external tables](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/external-tables.png)

   The local table *VenueTypes* that is created and populated. This reference data table is common in all tenant databases, so it can be represented here as a local table and populated with the common data. For some queries this may reduce the amount of data moved between the tenant databases and the *adhocanalytics* database.

    ![create table](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/create-table.png)

   If you include reference tables in this manner, be sure to update the table schema and data whenever you update the tenant databases.

4. Press **F5** to run the script and initialize the *adhocanalytics* database. 

Now you can run distributed queries, and gather insights across all tenants!

## Run ad-hoc distributed queries

Now that the *adhocanalytics* database is set up, go ahead and run some distributed queries. Include the execution plan for a better understanding of where the query processing is happening. 

When inspecting the execution plan, hover over the plan icons for details. 

Important to note, is that setting **DISTRIBUTION = SHARDED(VenueId)** when we defined the external data source, improves performance for many scenarios. Because each *VenueId* maps to a single database, filtering is easily done remotely, returning only the data we need.

1. Open ...\\Learning Modules\\Operational Analytics\\Adhoc Analytics\\*Demo-AdhocAnalyticsQueries.sql* in SSMS.
2. Ensure you are connected to the **adhocanalytics** database.
3. Select the **Query** menu and click **Include Actual Execution Plan**
4. Highlight the *Which venues are currently registered?* query, and press **F5**.

   The query returns the entire venue list, illustrating how quick and easy it is to query across all tenants and return data from each tenant.

   Inspect the plan and see that the entire cost is the remote query because we're simply going to each tenant database and selecting the venue information.

   ![SELECT * FROM dbo.Venues](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/query1-plan.png)

5. Select the next query, and press **F5**.

   This query joins data from the tenant databases and the local *VenueTypes* table (local, as its a table in the *adhocanalytics* database).

   Inspect the plan and see that the majority of cost is the remote query because we query each tenant's venue info (dbo.Venues), and then do a quick local join with the local *VenueTypes* table to display the friendly name.

   ![Join on remote and local data](media/sql-database-saas-tutorial-adhoc-analytics/query2-plan.png)

6. Now select the *On which day were the most tickets sold?* query, and press **F5**.

   This query does a bit more complex joining and aggregation. What's important to note is that most of the processing is done remotely, and once again, we bring back only the rows we need, returning just a single row for each venue's aggregate ticket sale count per day.
